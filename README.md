Attention fellow innovators!

As we prepare for the future of space travel, we recognize the importance of creating a sustainable and innovative dining experience for those living on the Red Planet. Our team is proud to present our Martian restaurant website, designed to meet the unique challenges of dining on Mars.

Our website offers a range of features, including a login/signup system for pre-registration, a general query bot to assist with any questions, video calling with loved ones back on Earth, SMS mailing for communication, and a cutting-edge Web3 payment gateway for secure transactions.

But our website is more than just a platform for dining. We are committed to sustainability, using advanced techniques such as hydroponics and vertical farming to grow our own produce and minimize waste. We are also dedicated to providing an otherworldly ambiance that transports diners to a different world, making our restaurant a truly unique experience.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
